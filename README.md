# NeomorphicFormValidation
This was a quick and fun project from Brad Traversy's 20 Projects with Vanilla Javascript course. This is a simple form built from scratch (html, css, js) that demonstrates some minimal validation before the default action of the submit button. I have also changed the look of the form after the intial build - just wanted to experiment a little with neomorphism.

# Validation
* required fields
* min maxlength
* email regex
* password match
